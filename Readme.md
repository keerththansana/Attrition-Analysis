# Attrition Analysis

Attrition Analysis is a project focused on understanding and predicting employee attrition within organizations. Leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, this repository aims to provide insights on factors influencing attrition and build models to forecast potential employee turnover.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of employee datasets
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Visualizations illustrating attrition trends and correlations
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Actionable insights and recommendations

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/attrition-analysis.git
cd attrition-analysis
```

Install required packages (e.g., using pip and requirements.txt):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your dataset (e.g., CSV format) in the `data` directory.
2. Run the main analysis script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. Review the results and visualizations in the `output` directory.
